A GPT powered voice search service. 


## How it works 
The bot receives voice prompts from a user and converts it to text using [Google Text to Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech). The text is then sent to [chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) as a prompt. Once the completion is received from Chat GPT the bot then converts it to speech using [Google Speech to Text](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech). <br><br>
This enables you to have a one to one conversation as you would with virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant   


## Challenges
- Challenges affecting Chat GPT eg model not sending completion that makes sense
